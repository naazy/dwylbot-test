related to the issue 45

If you follow the instruction on the [official Phoenix documentation](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/heroku) everything should work properly.

However sometimes it doesn't!

On Fedora 25 Elixir version is at the moment (10/05/17) 1.3.1. To tell Heroku to use a different version you need to create a config file. Just follow the steps described [here](https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir#configuration) and everything should be ok now
