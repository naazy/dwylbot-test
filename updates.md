**4 May 2017**
Simon has started working on dwylbot again
Currently working:
- User signs in to GitHub
- Authorises application
- Choose which repositories to add dwylbot too
- API requests GH to get a list of the repositories

Next stage:
- Review flow to sign up to GitHub, add tests (currently just a spike)
- To be able to click on each repo to create a new webhook (/dwylbot), postgres database is required [2 day estimate]
- Deployment
- Also to do next week: #26 (waiting before spamming the user)
- Start working on other features (next week)
